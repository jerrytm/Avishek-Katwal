i have finished creating the game.It's just simple but i can do more.i"ve used the assets from GitHub.if i didn't had those i can create 
them myself.


About the game.
There is only a ball that spawns randomly and the snake dies if you touch the wall .i've added 
rigidbody to the snake and ticked the trigger.i've also used the Get Axis to move the player .
Created a UI for the score board and coded it so it can actually tell the score.
Added bombs too so when the snake touches it it'll die. and that's that i think.
